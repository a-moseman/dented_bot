    "Right now, I'm a click away from using an SQL injection attack to gain access to the database of this website and gain your login credentials, as well as your IP address. I'll then proceed to leak your IP address onto my hacker forums, and then using an IP locator, I'll easily find your house and your name. With that I can access your social media accounts and proceed to ruin your life. You think I'm bluffing? You think that just because a bunch of 7 year olds say they can \"hack\", but actually can't, that I can't either? Let me shatter that facade for you. Using my team of hackers, we can trace what websites you've visited and what keystrokes you've used, and with that, I can get into your parents' bank account. I can drain it and make you dirt poor. Have you ever felt what it's like to be homeless? Well, you're about to. I can also use cross-site scripting to redirect your web browser to one of my private sites, and download illegal files onto your computer and get your parents locked up in prison. I'm your worst nightmare, and I'm about to make you endure living Hell. I'm nowhere and everywhere at the same time. Have fun regretting your existence, kiddo.",
    "You know what? I'm just going to say it. This server fucking sucks. I don't give a shit if the admins will mute me or if I get banned, but I want to get my message across, because it amazes me how many idiots in this server have a poor taste in quality. This server is like a fucking mental ward, and you all need to seek help. It's always the same damn shit everyday, and nothing new ever comes out of anyone's shriveled brains. Where are all the dank memes? Where are all of the good jokes? Where is all the dark humour? All I see is the same fucking Tumblr screenshots, and it's honestly boring as fuck. ALL of you are boring as fuck, if I'm being frank. I have pity for your parents, because I wouldn't question how would I able to nurture someone so milquetoast and ignorant for 18 years without putting a bullet through my head. You're all lame as fuck. I feel more stupider interacting with you all, and I wouldn't want to spend another second in this toxic atmosphere. Hell I'm actually glad this group exists. It keeps all the unfunny pricks away from the server that appreciate quality in their content. I hope you all get drafted and never come back. I'm done with you assholes.",

    "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker.

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.",
    "Waluigi is the ultimate example of the individual shaped by the signifier. Waluigi is a man seen only in mirror images; lost in a hall of mirrors he is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. You start with Mario - the wholesome all Italian plumbing superman, you reflect him to create Luigi - the same thing but slightly less. You invert Mario to create Wario - Mario turned septic and libertarian - then you reflect the inversion in the reflection: you create a being who can only exist in reference to others. Waluigi is the true nowhere man, without the other characters he reflects, inverts and parodies he has no reason to exist. Waluigi's identity only comes from what and who he isn't - without a wider frame of reference he is nothing. He is not his own man. In a world where our identities are shaped by our warped relationships to brands and commerce we are all Waluigi.",

    "The shopping cart is the ultimate litmus test for whether a person is capable of self-governing.\nTo return the shopping cart is an easy, convenient task and one which we all recognize as the correct, appropriate thing to do. To return the shopping cart is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able to return their cart. Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart. Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct.\nA person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with a law and the force that stands behind it.\nThe Shopping Cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society.",
    "Please put an NSFW tag on this. I was on the train and when I saw this I had to start furiously masterbating. Everyone else gave me strange looks and were saying things like \"what the fuck\" and \"call the police\". I dropped my phone and everyone around me saw this image. Now there is a whole train of men masterbating together at this one image. This is all your fault, you could have prevented this if you had just tagged this post NSFW.",

He is my comfort character and seeing him in an environment not meant for him brings me anxiety, so I will be expecting a reply to this DM when you have him in boxes and ready to relinquish him to someone who will treasure him like he deserves.",

    "Disclaimer: my hatred of geologists is purely theatrical, but if I did have to kill one for some reason, it would be very easy.\nI'd brandish my obsidian knife at them and they'd be compelled to approach. \"That's very cool,\" they'd say, confident in their superior strength and endurance from all the rocks they carry around at all times. They?d shower me with very interesting facts about obsidian and hover just out of range of the cutting edge, waiting for me to exhaust myself. \"But as it is volcanic glass, it's very fragile, you see, and isn't well-suited for use as a weap-\" and then I'd hit them with the wooden baseball bat in my other hand, which they would not have noticed because geologists can only see rocks and minerals."
